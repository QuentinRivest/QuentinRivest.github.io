### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because of the specific type of conversion involved. It had a number of feet with a decimal value converted into the format feet, inches, eighths of an inch. I enjoyed getting to use static_cast, math operators, and logical thinking to find a way to get these unique metrics of feet, inches, and eighths of an inch from a decimal value.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 2 was another one I enjoyed because of how you needed to find out ways to determine the total value of a blackjack hand. Although for many it was as simple as adding values together, the fact that the ace changed value depending on if it was with another ace or not added complexity to determining the value of a hand. It was fun to play around with different ways of trying to do this.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 part 1 was, I believe, the first lab we did involving object-oriented programming. I like how organized it is, all the member functions and variables being parts of the one class -- in this case the Pizza class. Figuring out the syntax, as well as the logic, involved in writing the constructors for the class was also enjoyable and helped me better comprehend the use of classes.
